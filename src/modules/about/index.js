        This company came to be because of Melissa always wanting a Vitamix. Laura thought they were
        too expensive and dragged her feet on the purchase but during the covid lockdown of 2020,
        Laura decided to finally surprise Melissa with the Queen of kitchen accessories. From that
        point our life changed. Melissa was a wizard, making dip after dip that were healthy, vegan,
        and highly sought after in our building. After a while, we realized, we might just have
        something! Thus, BigDips was born.
